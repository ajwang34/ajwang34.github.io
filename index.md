About Me
--------

I am a CS Masterâ€™s student at the University of Virginia advised Prof. Yangfeng Ji, with a research focus towards Natural Language Processing, specifically in the areas of language model interpretability, fairness, and bias. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from UVA in 2021 and started my research in NLP when I joined the UVA Information and Language Processing (ILP) Lab that summer.
