About Me
--------

I am a Research Associate at Johns Hopkins University in the [Human Language Technology Center of Excellence](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/). I am currently interested in controllable text generation, representation learning, and NLP for social good. Before that I worked with Prof. Yangfeng Ji at the University of Virginia in the [Information and Language Processing Lab](https://uvanlp.org/) where I earned an MS in computer science.
